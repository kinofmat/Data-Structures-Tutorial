Hello! I'm Kai Matkin, and in this tutorial, we will cover topics of how to use Stacks, Sets, and a Tree in python respectively. These are three common data structures that can be used in real world situations. 

I have found python to be a very simple to understand programming language. The syntax feels a lot more intuitve and it is easier to read than other languages I have used. In speaking on reading code, I would highly encourage you to read through and fully understand what the code is trying to accomplish. I know what it's like to be in college and have just skimmed over code blocks, or skipped them completely, in my text books before. I feel that I learn a lot better when I actually read through the code first and then try to implement the solution. Try to take a similar approach where you start coding, only after you have thought through what some different solutions might be. If you get stuck, try taking out a pen and paper and write through what is happening each step of the way in your program. I have found this helpful in my studies as well.

We will also cover how each structure performs in relation to the amount of time that it takes to complete the task. This will help to keep from writing programs that will take a very long time to finish its task.
